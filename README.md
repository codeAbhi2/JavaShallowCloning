Of course! Here's a short and clean **README.md** you can use for your project:

# EmployeeShallowClone

## ðŸ“„ About
This is a simple Java project demonstrating **shallow cloning** behavior.  
It uses an `Employee` class that holds a reference to an `Address` object.  
The project shows how, in shallow cloning, the original and cloned objects share the same referenced object.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Java

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
3. Compile and run `ShallowCloningExample.java`.

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts
- Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy
- Object Cloning in Java (`Cloneable` interface)
- Reference sharing in shallow cloning
